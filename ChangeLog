*10.10.2011*: basic installer GUI, written in HTML5 with JavaScript/jQuery scripting, and a simple Browser-DBus-Bridge wrapper that runs it with a "DBus" JavaScript object available
*10.10.2011*: the wrapper ensures uniqueness; --app-id argument available, else, "BrowserDbusApp" assumed
*12.10.2011*: pushed a basic installer core written in Vala
*19.10.2011*: fixed a bug involving killing the DBus client when a slow callback is passed to $.get; obviosly, the code structure must be re-written to use InitiateInstallerBus() function based on $.getScript
*21.10.2011*: added basic file copying/progress watching thread
*22.10.2011*: added progress watching fidelity options to the installer
*24.10.2011*: added linvo-installer-modules.c, a C file defining functions needed to manage Linvo modules
*24.10.2011*: copying thread now iterates through all the modules in a string array
*25.10.2011*: two seperate sequences of weighing modules (determining installed module size) and copying modules, mutex locked - copying requires the modules to be weighed in order to watch progress properly
*25.10.2011*: finding the mountpoint of a module now working
*25.10.2011*: GetPathsToCopy now returning an array of strings, and alphabetically sorted only enabled modules
*26.10.2011*: module weighing now made operational
*27.10.2011*: working copying
*28.10.2011*: webkit-dbus-bridge: added a "loading" page which appears while things load
*29.10.2011*: webkit-dbus-bridge: translations system using gettext that translates all the text nodes in the loaded DOM
*29.10.2011*: webkit-dbus-bridge: now also translates every attribute with a name contained in translated_attributes (currently only "title")
*29.10.2011*: CriticalError signal added to core and activated if no base modules are found / AbortingError signal added to abort the installation if anything is wrong
*30.10.2011*: fixed a minor fancybox bug in which the background overlay was not taking up the whole window
*30.10.2011*: re-organization of the source code, split into several directories: linvo-styles (common for all linvo "web" apps), linvo-installer-core, linvo-installer-gui, webkit-dbus-wrapper
*30.10.2011*: added a json-data package, which will provide static JSON data for the installer generated at compile time
*30.10.2011*: minor changes to webkit-dbus-wrapper: loads the "loading" frame earlier in code, fixed a bug when it was trying to replace it even if it does not exist
*30.10.2011*: language-info.js generated by json-data
*31.10.2011*: layed off basic JS structure for modules, GUI supports them now
*31.10.2011*: imports information about the applications on the LiveCD using a JSON object, in it's turn generated by the Linvo Builder
*31.10.2011*: basic applications module
*01.11.2011*: new monochrome icons for every module in the sidebar
*06.11.2011*: GUI connects to UDisks to pull data about the partition table
*07.11.2011*: fixed a bad-ass bug in the jscorebus, and now can transfer objects (D-Bus dicts) through the D-Bus bridge; 
*10.11.2011*: added basic partitioner.js code do resize/move file-systems; this is the only functionality we need not covered by UDisks
*11.11.2011*: added a helper for partitioner.js to change partition tables - parted_set_partition_geometry
*12.11.2011*: a basic partitioner GUI module
*13.11.2011*: fixed another important bug in jscorebus - disables garbage collecting for the functions set as async callbacks
*14.11.2011*: basic RetrieveInstallationInfo code in the core and integration with the GUI
*16.11.2011*: modules code refactored - GetMounts() to generate two HashTable's describing all the mounts and only the module mounts
*17.11.2011*: linvo-installer-core now using the system bus
*17.11.2011*: os-prober implemented
*18.11.2011*: basic "Configuration" object in RetrieveInstallationInfo
*19.11.2011*: basic AddConfigItem code
*20.11.2011*: "Configuration" object: now fills a "Users" array
*20.11.2011*: LaunchLnvconf implemented
*22.11.2011*: added a weighing helper that weighs modules more accurately accounting for the block size on the FS we're installing to
*22.11.2011*: the copying thread stops sending percantage if exceeds fidelity
*23.11.2011*: installer modules framework further improved, modules can embed HTML files now
*23.11.2011*: added basic timezone/language selectors
*23.11.2011*: partition size scaling: if a partition is too small to display in a convenient for the user way, it is sized up; the minimum percentage is 100/(count of all partitions) 
*24.11.2011*: fixed a bug in the installer modules framework in which it was possible to load a module after document.ready was fired, causing the translation engine to miss it and user inconveniances (something appearing after the loading bar)
*26.11.2011*: partitioner: added UDisks hotplugging of devices
*28.11.2011*: removing only a partition on DeviceRemove signal was fixed
*28.11.2011*: the partition-id scheme now obsolete, instead it references the device object by directly mapping the object to the DOM element
*28.11.2011*: display the free space on a partition in the GUI
*28.11.2011*: basic tooltips on the newly added add/remove/format/resize-move icons in the partitioner
*28.11.2011*: TryAddFreeSpace abstraction added and now called separately (after partitions) for each slave in order to add a free space in the end if any
*29.11.2011*: new DeviceAdded handler, now if a partition table is added it would wait for all the expected partitions to be also added before it builds the DOM structure of the partition table
